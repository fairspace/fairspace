Fairspace documentation!
========================

Fairspace is an open source research data management application that helps to capture 
metadata about the entities that are relevant for your research. We want data experts to be 
able to define semantic models in a user friendly, yet flexible way. 
Other users can then use these models to create a FAIR metadata layer that connects 
all data assets within an organisation. 

Its ambitions are to integrate with existing data infrastructure and to provide a way to 
give access datasets in this infrastructure.
