# Deployment workflow is supposed to be dependent on this one.

# 1. At the workflow start four jobs are triggered in parallel (generate version, building all services)
# 2. A job to build Docker image with Saturn service is triggered once version generated and Saturn artifacts
#       are built and uploaded
# 3. A job to build Docker image with Pluto service and Mercury bundle is triggered once version generated and
#       Pluto/Mercury artifacts are built and uploaded
